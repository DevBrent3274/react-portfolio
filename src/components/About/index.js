          <h1>A little about me... </h1>
          <p>I have traveled the world as a chef honing my skills in cuisine 
            working my way from home town inn to world class Michelln star 
            restaurants.  
          </p>
          <p>I am excited to turn the same passion I have for cuisine towards
            web development and looking to find like minded people who believe nature 
            and technology can develop in harmony along side one another.
          </p>
          <p>When I am not coding, I try to spend as much time outdoors 
            soaking up nature camping, paddle boarding and cycling to name a few.
            On a cold or rainier day you might find me at the museum or theater.
          </p>
          <p>If anyone would like to talk tech or the best meal they ever had
            (or debate best fast food burger - In-N-Out!) I would love to hear 
            from you!
          </p>
